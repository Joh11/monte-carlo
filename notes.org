* Roadmap
** Add error bars on my zoom of the magnetization to see if it is sensible
** Do a fit to find the critical scaling and temperature from the M(T) plot
** Make a block diagram of how my code works (files, classes, functions, ...)
* Ideas
** Compute the standard deviation for both the primitive method and the magnetization fluctuation
** Implement the cluster update method given in [[https://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.48.3249][this paper]]
