#+title: Project Report : Scaling function for the 3D Heisenberg ferromagnet

* Theoretical considerations

The standard way to define the Heisenberg model hamiltonian is the
following :

\begin{equation}
H = -J \sum_{<i j>} \vec S_i \cdot \vec S_j - \vec H \cdot \sum_i \vec S_i
\end{equation}

However, this sweeps under the rug the dimension and values of the
constants. In our case, we need to know the dimension of the constants
to be able to compare the energy to the thermal energy \(\sim k_B T
\). Let's focus on the external magnetic field term first. 

By definition, a system with a given magnetic moment \(\vec \mu\),
when put inside an external magnetic field \(\vec B\), will have the
following energy :

\begin{equation}
U = - \vec{\mu} \cdot \vec B
\end{equation}

In our case, the magnetic moment does not come from the angular
momentum of the electron, but from its spin. In this case, it can be
can be related to the spin by:
\begin{equation}
\vec \mu = g \frac{q_e}{2m_e} \vec S = g \mu_B \frac{\vec S}{\hbar}
\end{equation}
\(\mu_B = \frac{q_e\hbar}{2m_e}\) is a constant called Bohr magneton.

* Outline of the process
** Finding the right number of thermalization steps, such that the system is in thermal equilibrium
Using a simulation with a grid size of 30 at a temperature 2 (a stride
of 1000 for the measurements), we can clearly see that the energy
converges after 20% of the steps, i.e. 20000. This yields a number of
thermalizations steps of around 8.

Even though it converges, to get even more sensible results, we would
need to simulate with greater strides (of the order of \(N^3\)) such
that the samples are not too much correlated.

** Finding the critical temperature, and comparaison to the theoretical critical value
** Making a grid in H-T space to get the magnetic susceptibility
